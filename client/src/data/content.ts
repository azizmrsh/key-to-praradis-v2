This sin is likened in the Quran to eating the flesh of one's dead brother, illustrating its severity.\n\nBackbiting damages relationships, spreads negativity, and hardens the heart of both the speaker and the listener.

Surround yourself with righteous company: People who remind you of your moral obligations will help you avoid harmful speech.\n\n4.

Mental peace from fewer intrusive thoughts and desires\n\n3. Greater contentment with one's blessings rather than coveting what others have\n\n4.

By controlling what we allow our eyes to see, we protect our hearts from corruption and our minds from distraction. In a world designed to capture and exploit our attention, conscious management of our visual diet becomes an act of worship and self-liberation. Through consistent practice and sincere intention, we can train our eyes to see the world through a lens of spiritual consciousness rather than desire or envy.",

        conclusion: "Digital fasting isn't about rejecting technology altogether, but developing a healthier relationship with it. By periodically stepping away from our screens, we create space for deeper spiritual connection, more meaningful relationships, and greater presence in our lives. Like traditional fasting, the goal is not deprivation for its own sake, but rather purification and renewal. Start with small steps, be consistent, and watch how digital moderation transforms your spiritual experience in our connected age.",

It differs from admiration or positive ambition (ghibtah), where we appreciate others' blessings and aspire to similar good without wishing harm.\n\nEnvy stems from several spiritual ailments:\n\n1. A failure to recognize Allah's wisdom in distributing blessings\n2. Excessive love of this world\n3. Pride that makes us feel entitled to more than others\n4. Misunderstanding that our provision is predetermined\n5. Forgetting that blessings come with responsibilities and trials",

It can lead to destructive behaviors like backbiting, spreading rumors, or even causing harm to others.\n\n4.
