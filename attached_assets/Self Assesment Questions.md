-----
**Post-Assessment Flow**

After completing the self-assessment, the app will calculate a "struggle index" based on the user's answers. This index determines which sins appear to be most pressing for the user and guides the app's personalized recommendations.

**Scoring System**

- Each answer is scored from 1 (Never) to 5 (Always).
- Total scores are calculated per sin category.
- The app uses the total or average score per category to rank user struggles.

**Struggle Index and Recommendations**

- The app presents the top 1–2 areas of struggle.
- User can accept this recommendation or manually select another focus.
- The selected sin becomes the user's "active focus."

**Challenge Plan**

- User selects a focus duration (e.g. 7 days, 14 days, 40 days).
- The app recommends:
  - **Daily reflections** relevant to the sin
  - **Mini-challenges** (e.g. avoid backbiting for one day)
  - **Spiritual exercises** such as dhikr, journaling, or fasting
  - **Reward milestones** (e.g. badges for streaks)

**Daily Progress Tracking**

- Users log daily check-ins (e.g. "Did you stay mindful today?").
- Journaling prompts are optional and stored locally.
- Visual indicators (streak counter, chart) track growth over time.

**Encouragement and Support**

- If the user struggles repeatedly, the app responds with:
  - A supportive message (e.g. "Growth comes in steps—try again tomorrow")
  - A suggestion to view helpful content (e.g. a reminder video or dhikr)

**Language and Tone**

- The app uses **positive, compassionate language** throughout:
  - "You're making progress"
  - "Allah sees your effort"
  - "Today is another chance"

**Reassessment**

- Optional reassessment offered every 30 days
- User may switch focus at any time

This flow ensures the user remains supported, encouraged, and self-aware—without shame, and with sincere hope for lasting personal transformation.

**Privacy and Storage**

- No answers are transmitted externally
- Users can delete or reset their self-assessment at any time

**Future Considerations**
