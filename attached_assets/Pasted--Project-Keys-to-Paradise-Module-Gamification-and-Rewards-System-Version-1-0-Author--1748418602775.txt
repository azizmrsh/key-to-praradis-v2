## 1. Purpose and Scope

This module adds motivational structure and spiritual celebration to the user's journey by recognising progress through badges, streaks, and milestone rewards. It reinforces positive habits without undermining the sincerity or dignity of the spiritual path. All elements are designed to support reflection, istiqāmah (consistency), and personal discipline.
