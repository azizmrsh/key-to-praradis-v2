title: Self-Assessment Requirements -- Keys to Paradise App
---

# Overview

This document outlines the logic and question bank for the
self-assessment module of the Keys to Paradise app. The purpose of this
module is to help users privately identify the sins they struggle with
most and tailor their app experience accordingly.

## 1. Self-Assessment Structure

-   On first attempt of the self assessment, the users are presented
    with up to **10 randomised questions** from a pool of **20** for
    each sin.

-   Users may also later choose to assess themselves on a **single sin
    category** at any time from within the app.

-   This allows users to reflect on their progress in a specific area
    without retaking the full self-assessment.

-   Results are stored privately and may influence journaling prompts or
    content suggestions.

-   Each question is scored from **1 (Never)** to **5 (Always)**.

-   Total scores per sin are calculated and weighted.

-   The app recommends the **top 1--2 sins** based on scores.

-   Users may confirm the suggestion or select their own.

-   Users may also **skip self-assessment** and manually choose a
    **primary** and **secondary** sin.

## 2. Scoring and Recommendations

-   Each self-assessment session generates a score entry per sin, which
    is stored securely on-device.

-   These scores can be used to track changes in struggle level over
    time.

-   Results from self-assessments are reflected on the user\'s
    dashboard, allowing visualisation of spiritual growth.

-   After each assessment (full or single-sin), a summary entry is
    automatically added to the user's journal, noting:

    -   Date and time

    -   Sin(s) assessed

    -   Score(s) received

    -   Suggested focus (if any)

-   This journal entry is editable by the user and stored with their
    private reflections.

-   Initial assessment and subsequent full re-assessment selects 10
    random questions are presented from a pool of 20 per sin

-   Total possible score per sin: 10 questions × max score of 5 = **50**

-   Scores may be normalised as percentages to ensure fair comparison
    between categories

### Optional Refinements:

-   Some questions may include a weight value for greater insight (e.g.
    weight = 1.2)

-   Score = (response × weight), then totalled and normalised if needed

### Recommendation Logic:

-   Top sin becomes the default primary recommendation

-   If a second sin is within 10% of the highest, both may be shown

-   User is prompted: "Would you like to work on this, or choose another
    area?"

-   User may manually override recommendation

### Reassessment:

-   Optional reassessment is offered every 30 days or after milestone
    completions

-   Progress resets after 40 days if sin focus changes

-   Displayed score is average or normalised percentage (e.g. 62%)

-   If two sins are within 10% of each other, both may be suggested

-   Top sin becomes **primary focus**, second becomes optional secondary

## 3. Question Format

-   Each question targets a specific behavioural or emotional expression
    of the sin

-   Written in simple, introspective language

-   Users respond using a 1--5 scale:

    -   1 = Never

    -   2 = Rarely

    -   3 = Sometimes

    -   4 = Often

    -   5 = Always
